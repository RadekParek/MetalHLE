# HyperHLE-Fork

**HyperHLE-Fork** is a community-maintained fork of [HyperHLE](https://github.com/HyperHLE/HyperHLE), itself based on [touchHLE](https://github.com/touchHLE/touchHLE). The user-facing name of this project is **HyperHLE**.

HyperHLE is a high-level emulator for early iPhone OS apps. It reimplements selected iOS frameworks on the host, allowing compatible apps to run without booting iOS. This fork focuses on Android/mobile usability, fullscreen and orientation handling, graphics compatibility, and app-specific fixes. It is not an official Apple product.

The repository does not distribute commercial apps or iOS firmware. Put an app bundle (`.app`) or IPA (`.ipa`) that you are entitled to use in `touchHLE_apps/`; it will appear in the app picker.

## Platforms and features

- Builds for Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Virtual iPhone and iPad device profiles.
- Android touch input and fullscreen/orientation handling.
- Ongoing GLES, EAGL, Core Animation, audio, and iOS framework compatibility work.
- Download build artifacts from the [HyperHLE GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/KlugKlugTG/HyperHLE-Fork/actions/workflows/HyperHLE_release.yml).
